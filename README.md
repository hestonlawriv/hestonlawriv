My first project: The CACB Tentative Ruling Database is a collection of court documents which I have compiled, optimized, and republished in a format that can be used for legal research. There is still much that needs to be done, including making the database more easily searchable. Check it out here: https://hestonlaw.com/cacb-tentatives/
